# Trade Journal Assistant (In Progress)

## Overview
**Problem**
Traders need an efficient, smart way to log, store trades, and access data driven insights from those data.
**Solution**
**Trade Journal Assistant** is a web-based trading journal designed to make trade tracking smarter, faster, and more insightful. It aims to centralize trade logging, automate performance metrics, and introduce a natural language AI assistant for interactive data queries - all tailored to the workflow of active traders.

This project is currently in development.

## Resources Used
Database - SSMS
AI model - Ollama/Ilama3
Key library used:Pandas, sqlalchemy, streamlit, langchain



## Features
- **Centralized Journal**: Log trades (entry/exit, P&L, notes) in one place.
- **Automated Metrics**: Calculate key stats (P&L, win rate, trade count) for quick insights.
- **AI Chatbot**: Enable natural language trade entry (e.g., “I shorted 100 XYZ at $10, covered at $9.5”) and data queries (e.g., “What’s my win rate?”), reducing effort and enhancing interactivity.
